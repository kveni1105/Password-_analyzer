# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation Tool

A GUI-based Python application that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords using multiple metrics like character variety, entropy, and dictionary comparison.

## 🛡️ About the Project

This project was developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at Elevate Labs**, supported by **Skill India** and the **Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India**.  
The tool aims to promote **cyber hygiene** by helping users understand and improve their password security.
